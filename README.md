### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I write code. With my hands. And sometimes my brain.
I am a software developer from **Toronto, Ontario**.

Some languages / platforms / operating systems / tools I work with daily:
- Node.js and Deno javascript runtimes
- Clang, Java
- Ubuntu Server 22.04, MacOS 12.5, FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE, Windows 11 with Ubuntu 22.04 via WSL2
- systemd service manager
- vim, VSCode
- React, Fresh
